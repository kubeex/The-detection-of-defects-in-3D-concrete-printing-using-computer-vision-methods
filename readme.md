# The Detection of Defects in 3D Concrete Printing Using Computer Vision Methods



## Abstract

This thesis focuses on the design and implementation of a system
for monitoring quality during the 3D printing of concrete using
computer vision methods and laser triangulation. The goal is to
measure the geometry of deposited layers in real time and, based on
a comparison with the desired values, detect potential defects. The
system is implemented in Python with an emphasis on a modular
architecture that allows easy adaptation to different types of equip-
ment and future extension with additional functionalities, such as
feedback control of the printing process. The aim is to provide a
universal measurement tool for quality monitoring that can serve
as a fundamental building block for further automation of the 3D
concrete printing processes.
